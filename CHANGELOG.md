  `Range` raises `RangeInvalid` when testing `math.nan`.

  Update documentation.
- [#262](https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/pull/262):
  Fix a performance issue of exponential complexity where all of the dict keys were matched against all keys in the schema.
  This resulted in O(n*m) complexity where n is the number of keys in the dict being validated and m is the number of keys in the schema.
  The fix ensures that each key in the dict is matched against the relevant schema keys only. It now works in O(n).
- [#266](https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/pull/266):
  Remove setuptools as a dependency.
